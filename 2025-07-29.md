Today I continued working on my inventory system project. I fixed an existing bug that prevented the list of current items to render in the browser.

Afterwards, I implemented a search functionality so that the user of the inventory cah search for items that live up to a certain search criteria. The user also has to select which location they want to search for a given item in.
