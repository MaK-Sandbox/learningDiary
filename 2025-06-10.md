Today I fiddled around with better-sqlite3 with the goal to get acquainted with some of the tools and concepts relevant to using SQLite. This mostly took place in a sandbox project.

Once I was comfortable, I started a new project with an express server that gets the same data from a mock. The idea is to return data from the database to the user when the user connects to certain endpoints with the api.
