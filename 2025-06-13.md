Today I implemented a middlewear function which checks for a query parameter called API_KEY and checks if the user requesting the information from the server has the required permission to see the data or if an API_KEY is provided at all.

Once this was tested for and worked smoothly, I used express router objects to better organize the routes used in my express application so that each route is specified in each their router.

I also did a few challenges on codewars.com in the morning just to get my day started.
