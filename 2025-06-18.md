I began my day with a few challenges on codewars. Today I learned the value of - programming isn't the most important task of a developer. Instead, it is the ability to debug. How did I realise this? I had made a solution to a task and tried to submit it and the real task turned out to be finding out what the problem with my solution was.

After that I moved on to more SQL. This time I toyed around with adding a table to the SQLITE database where there is a foreign key.
