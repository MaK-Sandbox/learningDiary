I began my day with a few challenges on codewars. I had plans to work on a specific task but instead spent the day applying for apprenticehips and calling up companies who take in apprentices.

While updating my CV, I reviewed my GitHub repositories and highlighted a few of th em on my CV.

Tomorrow should hopefully consist of more programming heavy tasks.
