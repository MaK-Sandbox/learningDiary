# Tuesday 17th June, 2025

I began my day with a few challenges on codewars. Today's tasks were harder than the ones from the days prior.

Once I was done with these, I continued with yesterday's undone tasks which were about creating new endpoints for /users with routes /register, /login and /logout - a continuation of my sql express backend project
