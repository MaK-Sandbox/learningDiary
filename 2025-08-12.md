Today I spent time converting the backend of my inventory system project from JavaScript to TypeScript. It took the entire day but I did manage to complete the migration and run the typescript command tsc at root level without any errors. My partner who has previous experience with TypeScript supervised the migration to ensure that everything was done correctly.
