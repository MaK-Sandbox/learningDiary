Today I continued to work with my express server and making endpoints for put and and delete requests before I received a challenge to enable a user to via the url path of a get request to request (an) employee(s) that live up to certain legal criteria. Once this was added, I began to work on error handling my code but I haven't finished the error handling for all endpoints yet.
