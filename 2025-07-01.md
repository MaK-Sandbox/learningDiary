I continued with a trying to debug a problem with my code in my sql-express-server project that has been reoccuring for the past few days. I managed to fix it with the help of ChatGPT addressing what I had misunderstood about how the code should work and then suggesting how I can fix it.

I also created an interface where users can either sign in or register. If a user tries to register but the e-mail that the user attempts to sign up with already exists in the database, the user receives an error. Once an existing user signs in successfully, the user is redirected to a dashboard that can only be accesses for users who are already signed in (in an active session which hasn't expired). Once the session ends, the user is signed out.
