Today I fixed some bug in my inventory project regarding the icons that I added to the project the day before, so that a user can edit a single item or delete a single item from the inventory.

I also implemented a feature to save the edited data to the database or abort the process and instead go back to the list of current items in the inventory.

I had already implemented a search functionality earlier this week but today I actually added a parent element to the frontend where search results could be shown in the form of a table.

After a long break away from my computer, I came back to study up on SFTP to learn about how I can download the current database from the remote server onto my local machine for futher testing of the newly implemented features.

Tomorrow will probably consist of further testing and optimising the current frontend codebase - and there is plenty of room for improvenment
