I began my day with a few challenges on codewars and once this was done, I created a new SQL table in the database of my SQL Express project.
The command to create the new User table was executed in sql directly in DB Broswer.

Once this was done, I created a new Express Router for Users to handle all get and post requests for route /api/v1/users
